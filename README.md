# Patient Risk Prediction (Demo)

This project demonstrates a simple deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict patient health risk from synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data.

This is a demo version inspired by typical healthcare ML workflows (NO real patient data).

## Features
- Synthetic patient dataset
- Data preprocessing with Pandas
- Neural network (Keras Sequential model)
- Train/test split
- Performance metrics
- Demo notebook included

More files will be added soon.
